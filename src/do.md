## 1. Introduction


The bibliographies listed on **philHub** are not exhaustive.

The texts linked on this site where retrieved via generic google-searches. You may suggest texts that you find suitable for public participation. Do so either directly on the philHub repository page via [hypothes.is](#i--hypothesis) or propose a project via the [philHub forums](http://agora.philhub.co); by using the forum your submission is next to guaranteed to catch attention.

## 2. How to participate
**PhilHub thrives on your participation. What can you do?**
- Read philosophy and think about it. Share your thoughts directly within the shared pdf of a philosophical text, ask questions about certain concepts or paragraphs, answer questions of your peer reviewers (sic!) if you can. Discuss problems at hand.
- Engage in the [philHub Community](http://agora.philhub.co), discuss projects, philosophy and philHub itself.
- Use the hypothes.is sidebar or the forum to propose content that remains yet to be implemented.
- Use GitHub to directly revise a page on philHub and send it in with a pull request.


### 2.1 Hypothes.is

![](https://i.imgur.com/RYuEg3x.gif)

The **hypothes.is sidebar** is enabled by default. You should see it on the right side of your screen. Links to pdfs, regardless of whether on- or off-site, will be passed through the prefix ````https://via.hypothes.is/````. This will enable the sidebar.


#### Use the _h.sidebar_ to review texts
You have to create an account with hypothes.is to annotate and comment _any_ site on the internet. We'll use this function for explicitly reviewing philosophical texts, that is, to annotate, ask, discuss, give additional information, cross-reference and whatever else may present itself.

You can get detailed information on the [hypothes.is website <i class="fa fa-external-link fa-fw"></i>](https://hypothes.is/).

### 2.2 GitHub Pull-Request

This function may be used to have direct influence on the content of this Repository. _PhilHub_ is mirrored on GitHub. You may _pull_ any available article and propose changes, write extensions, correct mistakes or use them for whatever else purpose you see fit. By _pushing_ your changes back via GitHub, they may eventually be implemented into the site.

To this end you should familiarize yourself with the _way of the Git_, if you want to participate. Plenty of documentation can be found online.
