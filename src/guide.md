>Es ist völlig richtig und in der besten Ordnung: »Man kann mit der Philosophie nichts anfangen«. Verkehrt ist nur, zu meinen, damit sei das Urteil über die Philosophie beendet. Es kommt nämlich noch ein kleiner Nachtrag in der Gestalt einer Gegenfrage, ob, wenn schon wir mit ihr nichts anfangen können, die Philosophie am Ende nicht mit uns etwas anfängt, gesetzt, daß wir uns auf sie einlassen.

@ _Heidegger, Martin - HGA 40, Einführung in die Metaphysik, S. 14_

#### 1.2 Jim Pryor's Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper
http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html
>Philosophical writing is different from the writing you'll be asked to do in other courses. Most of the strategies described below will also serve you well when writing for other courses, but don't automatically assume that they all will. Nor should you assume that every writing guideline you've been given by other teachers is important when you're writing a philosophy paper. Some of those guidelines are routinely violated in good philosophical prose (e.g., see the guidelines on grammar, below).

#### 1.3 Jim Pryor's Guidelines on Reading Philosophy
http://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/reading.html
>It will be difficult for you to make sense of some of the articles we'll be reading. This is partly because they discuss abstract ideas that you're not accustomed to thinking about. They may also use technical vocabulary which is new to you. Sometimes it won't be obvious what the overall argument of the paper is supposed to be. The prose may be complicated, and you may need to pick the article apart sentence by sentence. Here are some tips to make the process easier and more effective.


#### 1.3 Lee Braver's "How I Mark Up Philosophy Texts"
https://www.academia.edu/9281334/How_I_Mark_Up_Philosophy_Texts
>Doing philosophy is as much a craft as it is an art, and quality work requires the mastery of a number of skills. Unfortunately, much of the development of the distinctive skills of philosophy, namely, reading, thinking, and the construction and writing of arguments, evolves through trial and error instead of being deliberately honed via a method or techniques devised by those more experienced.


#### 1.4 Giving a Talk in Philosophy
